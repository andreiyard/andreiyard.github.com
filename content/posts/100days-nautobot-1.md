Today I'm starting the [**#100DaysOfNautobot** challenge](https://github.com/nautobot/100-days-of-nautobot) — a daily commitment to learning and working with [Nautobot](https://www.nautobot.com/), a modern Network Source of Truth and extensible automation platform built on Python.

## Goal

Over the next 100 days, I want to deepen my understanding of Nautobot, its plugins, API, data models, and its potential for automating network infrastructure.

## Plan

- Set up a local development environment  
- Explore Nautobot's core features and architecture  
- Develop and document custom plugins and integrations  
- Share notes, code examples, and findings daily

I'll be posting short updates and progress logs here and on social media using the hashtag **#100DaysOfNautobot**.

If you're into network automation or already working with Nautobot — feel free to reach out! I'd love to connect and share experiences.

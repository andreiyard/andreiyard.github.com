My fast and lightweight personal blog powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions, and hosted for free with GitHub Pages.

## How to add new post
```hugo new --kind post content/posts/test-post-1.md```  
When we choose kind "post", the hugo initializes new content file using template from "archetypes" dir.
